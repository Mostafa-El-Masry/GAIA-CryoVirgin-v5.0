    title: "Bad Days Protocol: Minimum Baseline to Not Collapse",
    paragraphs: [
      "Bad days will come. The goal is not to avoid them, but to reduce the damage they do to you and to your future.",
      "Define a 'minimum baseline' for bad days: the absolute smallest version of self-care you will still try to do when everything feels heavy.",
      "This can be things like: one proper meal, one glass of water, a quick shower, answering one important message, and going to bed before a certain time.",
      "Write your bad day protocol somewhere visible so that when the next crash comes, you don't have to think — you just follow the script.",
    ],
