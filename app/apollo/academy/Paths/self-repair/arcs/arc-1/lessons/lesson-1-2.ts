    title: "Designing One Small Daily Anchor",
    paragraphs: [
      "A daily anchor is a tiny action that tells your brain: 'We are still on my side.' It must be so small that you can do it even on a bad day.",
      "Think of something that takes 2–5 minutes and is realistic even when you are tired: drinking a glass of water slowly, washing your face with care, writing one honest sentence in a notebook.",
      "This is not a full routine. It is one anchor. Later we can add more, but right now you are proving that you can keep one promise to yourself.",
      "Choose a time window for this anchor (for example: sometime between waking up and leaving the house), not a strict minute on the clock.",
    ],
  },
