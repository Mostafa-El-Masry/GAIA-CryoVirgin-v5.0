    paragraphs: [
      "Self-repair movement is not about punishing yourself at the gym. It is about reminding your body that it is allowed to move and feel alive.",
      "Pick the easiest possible form of movement you can sustain this week: a short walk near your home, stretching on the floor, or a 5-minute routine.",
      "Your first goal is ridiculous on purpose: something like '2 minutes of stretching after I brush my teeth' or 'walk to the corner and back'.",
      "If you already exercise sometimes, make this lesson about making the foundation more gentle and more consistent, not heavier.",
