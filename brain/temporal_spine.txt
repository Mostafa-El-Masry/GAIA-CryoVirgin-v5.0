GAIA CryoVirgin — Temporal Spine (Week 3)

Time is a first-class structure in GAIA.
All judgment depends on consistent temporal meaning.

Definitions:

DAY
- A calendar day.
- May contain zero or more inputs.
- Absence of input is recorded as silence.

WEEK
- 7 consecutive days.
- Primary unit for pattern detection.
- Weekly summaries are allowed, judgments are not.

CYCLE
- 4 consecutive weeks.
- Minimum window for escalation.
- Used for trajectory statements later.

Rules:
- No retroactive edits across cycles.
- Silence is preserved, never auto-filled.
- All inputs must reference DAY and WEEK IDs.
