GAIA CryoVirgin — Domain Locking (Week 2)

These are the only domains GAIA is allowed to reason about.
Anything outside this list is explicitly out of scope.

1. Wealth
   - Income, savings, investments, certifications cost, financial trajectory

2. Health
   - Physical condition, energy, sleep, degradation, recovery

3. Work
   - Job conditions, effort, learning-to-output ratio, stagnation

4. Learning
   - Skill acquisition, study consistency, application vs theory

5. Identity
   - Values, self-image, long-term direction, integrity

Rules:
- No new domains may be added mid-year.
- All inputs must map to exactly one domain.
- Cross-domain reasoning is forbidden until Phase III.
